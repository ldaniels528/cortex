Data-Driven Model of Programming

Anonymous functions and data (including arrays)

[1,2,3] is an anonymous 3-element array

All data are also objects

? [1,2,3].length 
-> 3

Data can be mapped using anonymous functions

? [1,2,3].map{ |x| x * 10 }
-> [10, 20, 30]

? [1,2,3].flip()
-> [3, 2, 1]

? [1,2,3].flip().map{ |x| x * 10 }
-> [30, 20, 10]
